# (PART) Linear regression {-}

# The linear regression model

Consider $n$ independent observations $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ of a dependent variable (also called response variable).
Collect all of these observations into a vector
$$
\mathbf y = \begin{pmatrix}
y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n
\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb R^n
$$
